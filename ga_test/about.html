        <h3>Jordan Truelove</h3>
        <p>President- Public Adjuster<br />
    Licensed in PA, NJ, DE, CT</p>

        <p>
            Jordan started his career working for a Pennsylvania based Real Estate Developer as a Project Manager. In this position, Jordan managed multimillion dollar building projects. He grew an
            extensive network of construction, legal, and real estate professionals, many of whom he still works with.<br /><br />
            Coming from a large family full of construction professionals, he has been skilled and equipped in all aspects of Building/Remodeling for the last 15 years.<br /><br />
            Trained and certified as an Architectural Designer, Mr. Truelove's ability to “get the job done” quickly and efficiently earned him an award from the American Institute of Architects
            and more recently from the Historic Preservation Leagues in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  Jordan has been a Licensed Public Adjuster for over 7 Years. <br /><br />
            Jordan's methodology has and always will be “The best compliment I can ever receive from a previous happy client, is referring us to the next client.” His business model of honest transparency
            and not over charging for his services, has been proven successful by exponential growth over the past three years.<br /><br />
            Jordan is married with 2 young children and lives in Bucks County, PA.

        <h3>Eric Dekker</h3>
        <p>Vice President - Public Adjuster<br />
            Licensed in PA, NJ<br/>
            Xactimate Certified</p>


        <p>
            Eric began working as a commercial carpenter at 18 years old specializing in framing, drywall, and suspended ceiling. After working 7 years in the construction field, Eric returned to college to
            expand his horizons. After graduating from Bucks County Community College with an associates degree with studies focused in the physical sciences, Eric entered the Insurance Adjusting field working
            as a construction estimator and damage consultant.<br /><br />
            Today, Eric is a Licensed Public Adjuster working in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Having a strong construction background is essential for being able to properly represent property owners when
            negotiating an insurance claim; however, in addition to that, Eric possesses a strong work ethic, sense of justice, and “tenacious personality.” These characteristics makes him
            ideally suited for handling property damage claims, never giving up until all possible avenues have been exhausted.
        </p>
